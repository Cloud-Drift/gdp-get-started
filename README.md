# gdp-get-started
This repository contains two notebooks to get you started with the [hourly dataset version 2.00](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp/hourly_data.php) of the [NOAA Global Drifter Program](https://www.aoml.noaa.gov/phod/gdp/index.php) using python and the [*xarray* library](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/). 

- `get_started_with_hourly_gdp_data.ipynb` demonstrate how load lazily the hourly dataset and display a couple of plots.

- `gdp_compare_6h_1h.ipynb` is a simple comparison between the hourly dataset and the 6-hourly dataset.

This notebook should be readily executable in a binder environment which can be launched by clicking the "launch binder" badge above :point_up:. Alternatively, you can run the notebook in a python environment containing the python libraries listed in the file `environment.yml`.
